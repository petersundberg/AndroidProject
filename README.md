# AndroidProject


I started with project "Inköpslista":
First commit Inköpslista
200608: Minor changes, mostly added comments
200609: Trying to make CreateListActivity preserve list when changing to Landscape mode but cannot find a way to do that

...

Because of code becoming very messy and therefore diffcult to understand, I start over with a new project; "AndroidProject".

Created Activity to Add customer, Show all customers, About app and API.

200621: Added API requests.
